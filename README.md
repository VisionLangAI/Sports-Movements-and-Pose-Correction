# Sports-Movements-and-Pose-Correction

The Sports Movements, Exercise, and Pose Correction Learning and Teaching Dataset contains structured data collected from exercise sessions to support research in sports education, motion analysis, and AI-based posture correction. It includes information on user demographics, exercise types, difficulty levels, and session details, alongside quantitative measures such as balance, smoothness, accuracy, pose velocity, and tempo alignment. Each record represents a unique training instance, enriched with detected movement errors, correction suggestions, and improvement scores before and after feedback. This dataset is suitable for developing machine learning models for exercise classification, posture assessment, and personalized performance feedback in intelligent sports training environments.
